            In the mid '90s, Tobias formed a folk music band with Lindsay and Maebe which he called Dr. Funke's 100 Percent Natural Good Time Family Band Solution. The group was underwritten by the Natural Food Life Company, a division of Chem-Grow, an Allen Crayne acqusition, which was part of the Squimm Group. Their motto was simple: We keep you alive. I don't care if it takes from now till the end of Shrimpfest. Oh by the way, Doctor said no kissing her on the face for one week. I was like make it two weeks, see if I care! Make love in your *own* hand, Mother!
